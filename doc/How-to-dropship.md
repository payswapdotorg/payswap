Orders are sent directly from your wholesaler to your customers, so you can work on what mattersâ€”your products, marketing, and customers.</p><h3><span style="color: inherit;">Step 1: Commit to Starting a Dropshipping Business</span></h3><p>Just like any other business, dropshipping demands commitment and a long-term perspective. If you're expecting quick riches from minimal part-time effort, you're likely to be disappointed.</p><p>It's crucial to approach your dropshipping business with realistic expectations regarding the necessary investment of time and potential for profit. This mindset will help you stay motivated and prevent you from giving up prematurely.</p><p>As a beginner, you'll have to invest significantly in one of two valuable currencies: time or money.</p><h3><span style="color: inherit;">Step 2: Choose a Dropshipping Business Idea</span></h3><p>The second step in your journey to mastering how to start a dropshipping business is conducting thorough market research. This is akin to choosing a retail location, considering competitors, and assessing trends when opening a physical store. You'll want to explore a niche that genuinely interests you and has the potential for profitability.</p><p>However, finding validated product ideas to sell can be challenging.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/dropshipping-products_c621d387-1cfa-474c-8a6f-05889c56d31a.jpg?v=1684460593" alt="dropshipping products"></p><p><br></p><p>To help spark your creativity and identify profitable niches, CanCan maintains a curated list of trending products based on top-selling categories on the platform. Concentrating on niche and trending products can help your store gain traction and differentiate itself from more established competitors.</p><p>Niche products often attract a passionate customer base, making it easier to target specific audiences and raise awareness of your products.</p><p>Consider starting with niche categories like fitness, fashion, beauty products, electronics, phone accessories, or yoga-related items, as they can be excellent entry points for dropshipping with minimal upfront costs.</p><p><strong>Google Trends or Keywords Everywhere.&nbsp;</strong>You can utilize tools such as Google Trends to gauge a product's popularity over time and Keywords Everywhere to assess its search volume and competitiveness. DSers order volume can help you identify the potential of your chosen business idea.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/google-trends_80482cda-928b-440e-a51c-20dfede24ed7.png?format=webp&amp;v=1684460621" alt="google trends"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/keywords-everywhere_221739e1-d5d4-4ba2-855c-f6230cd3ac90.png?format=webp&amp;v=1684460645" alt="keyword everywheres"></p><p><strong>DSers order volume.</strong>&nbsp;In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dsers.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 128, 96);">DSers</a>, you can search for products based on order volume to determine the potential of your business idea.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/dser.png?format=webp&amp;v=1684460685" alt="dsers"></p><p>While the growth of ecommerce offers tremendous opportunities for aspiring dropshipping entrepreneurs, it also introduces significant competition. Therefore, competitor research is essential when creating your dropshipping business plan to ensure your success in selling your products.</p><h3><span style="color: inherit;">Step 3: Do Competitive Research</span></h3><p>Now that you've decided on your product offerings, it's time to investigate your competition and understand how they operate. Competitors can provide valuable insights into achieving success and help you formulate a robust marketing plan for your dropshipping business.</p><p>If your market is saturated with competitors (which is common in dropshipping), focus your research on approximately five other dropshipping companies, including a couple of major players such as Walmart, eBay, or Amazon. This focused approach will keep you on track and guide your next steps effectively.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(55, 65, 81); background-color: rgb(247, 247, 248);">Here are some ways to conduct competitive research:</span></p><ul><li><strong>Run a Google search.&nbsp;</strong>Perform a Google search to identify your top five competitors based on key search terms relevant to your niche. If you want to focus on a specific country, you can use a third-party tool like Ahrefs or SEMRush to find keyword data in those areas.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Use competitor spy tools like&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.similarweb.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 128, 96);"><strong>Similarweb</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 128, 96);"><strong>Alexa</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Utilize competitor analysis tools like Similarweb and Alexa to track your competitors' online activities, including social media profiles, top traffic sources, visitor statistics, and even their own competitors.</li><li><strong>Browse social media.</strong>&nbsp;Explore social media to uncover Facebook ads within your niche and examine the leading brands in your market. Analyze their communication with customers, the design of their social media feeds, and their engagement levels.</li></ul><p>Gather comprehensive information about your top competitors, including details about their websites, pricing strategies, marketing methods, product descriptions, reputation, and more. Organize your research in a spreadsheet for easy reference when making decisions for your store.</p><p>For instance, if you plan to use email marketing to promote your business, you can consult your spreadsheet to determine if competitors are already employing this tactic and learn about their strategies, all in one convenient location.</p><h3><span style="color: inherit;">Step 4: Choose a Dropshipping Supplier</span></h3><p>Selecting the right dropshipping supplier is a critical step in building a successful dropshipping business. Reliable suppliers are essential because, without them, your business would lack the necessary products to fulfill customer orders, jeopardizing its existence.</p><p>By this point, you've identified the dropshipping products you want to sell and confirmed their potential profitability. Now, it's essential to find a dropshipping supplier that can deliver the high-quality service you need to foster growth. Ecommerce platforms like CanCan simplify this process by offering plug-and-play solutions for connecting you with potential suppliers, such as DSers.</p><p>DSers is a marketplace that streamlines the process of discovering and adding products to your online store. Whether you're interested in electronics, fashion, toys, or other trending items, DSers enables you to find profitable products from dropshipping suppliers worldwide and effortlessly integrate them into your store with just one click.</p><p>The DSers app effectively manages the forwarding of customer orders to your chosen dropshipping supplier, eliminating the need for you to worry about packaging, shipping, or inventory management. Best of all, it costs nothing to get started.</p><p>DSers employs AliExpress to help you explore and add products to your store. If you want to gather more information about product quality or shipping times or further evaluate a supplier, you can easily do so through the DSers product page.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/dsers_1b03750e-071c-4c31-b87c-0712379c118f.png?format=webp&amp;v=1684460711" alt="dsers product page"></p><p>When you click a supplierâ€™s link, you end up on its AliExpress page, where you can find reviews, top selling products, and more.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/dsers-suppliers-page.png?format=webp&amp;v=1684460735" alt="dsers suppliers page"></p><p>It's essential to aim for selling quality products from DSers suppliers that offer ePacket shipping, especially if your supplier is based in China. ePacket is an affordable and expedited shipping option, enabling your customers in countries like the US, the UK, and Canada to receive their orders in just a couple of weeks, at a minimal cost.</p><h3>Step 5: Build Your Ecommerce Store</h3><p>To start a dropshipping business, you'll need an ecommerce platform like CanCan. This platform will serve as your online store, where you can direct traffic, showcase and sell products, and process payments.&nbsp;</p><p>CanCan simplifies the process of building and launching your ecommerce website, from selecting a domain name to adding marketing and sales plugins.

While we can't provide legal advice, we can offer insights into three commonly used business structures:</p><h4>Sole proprietorship</h4><p>&nbsp;This is the simplest business structure to implement but offers no personal liability protection. In this setup, your personal assets may be at risk if your business faces legal issues. Filing requirements are minimal, and you report your business earnings on your personal taxes, without the need for additional state or federal filings.</p><h4>Limited liability company (LLC)</h4><p>An LLC offers increased protection for your personal assets by establishing your business as a separate legal entity. Although it's not foolproof, an LLC provides more protection than a sole proprietorship. You may have to fulfill additional filing requirements and pay incorporation and ongoing fees.</p><h4>C corporation</h4><p>Major corporations typically adopt the C corporation structure, which, when executed correctly, provides the most robust liability protection. However, it can be more expensive to establish and is subject to double taxation, as income doesn't pass directly to shareholders.</p><p>The choice of business structure is significant and best made in consultation with legal professionals. Most small entrepreneurs often opt for either a sole proprietorship or an LLC.</p><p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Keep in mind that the business structure and EIN (employer identification number) information provided here apply primarily to entrepreneurs in the United States.</p><h4>Request an EIN number for your business</h4><p>The IRS mandates that all businesses have an employer identification number (EIN), which functions as a Social Security number for your business. You'll need this EIN to file taxes, apply for wholesale dropshipping accounts, open a bank account, and handle various aspects of your business.</p><p>Fortunately, obtaining an EIN is a straightforward and free process, as you can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 128, 96);">apply for an EIN number online</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 7: Get Your Finances in Order</h3><p>A common mistake among entrepreneurs when starting a business is intermingling personal and business finances. This can lead to confusion, complicate accounting, expose personal assets to business liabilities, and raise red flags with the IRS during audits.</p><p>It's vital to maintain a clear separation between your business and personal finances as much as possible. To achieve this, open new accounts in your business's name, including:</p><h4>Business checking account</h4><p>This account should serve as the central hub for all your business finances. Deposit all business revenue into it and withdraw expenses from it. This approach simplifies accounting significantly.</p><h4>Credit card</h4><p>Use a dedicated business credit card exclusively for business expenses and dropshipping inventory purchases. Many rewards travel cards can offer substantial benefits, given the volume of merchandise you're likely to buy from suppliers.</p><h4>Collect sales tax</h4><p>Depending on your state and order destinations, you may need to collect sales tax. Consult your state's department of commerce to register as an online retailer and determine the frequency of tax submissions required.</p><p>Learn more about how to pay sales tax and liability by reading&nbsp;<a href="https://bench.co/blog/tax-tips/drop-shipping-sales-tax" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 128, 96);">Drop Shipping and Sales Tax: A Simple Guide by Bench</a>.</p><h4>Local business licenses&nbsp;</h4><p>Some cities and towns require businesses to obtain licenses, although the necessity might vary for dropshipping ecommerce businesses. It's essential to research local laws and regulations to determine if any licenses are required.</p><h4>Incorporating outside the United States</h4><p>Incorporating Outside the United States: International merchants can also incorporate businesses in the United States to gain access to US-based dropshippers and customers. This process may involve visiting the US to complete necessary paperwork, appointing a trusted US-based business partner, or hiring an agency to manage the setup.</p><p>The following resources can help get you started with understanding this process:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.delawareregisteredagent.com/how-to/non-us-delaware-llc-corporation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 128, 96);">Non-resident Delaware LLC and Corporation for Foreigners</a>, by Delaware Corporate Headquarters&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><h3>Step 8: Market Your Dropshipping Store</h3><p>Now that you've learned how to start a dropshipping business and set up your online store, it's time to focus on marketing and promoting your new venture. To stand out in the competitive dropshipping landscape, you may need to invest additional effort into your marketing and advertising strategies as part of your dropshipping business plan.</p><p>With many dropshipping tasks automated, you can concentrate on marketing your business through various channels, including:</p><ol><li><strong>Paid ads (Facebook and Google).&nbsp;</strong>Facebook ads are scalable and capable of performing well, especially for products that inspire impulse purchases. Additionally, Google Shopping Ads can help you target long-tail keywords where customers are more likely to make purchases.</li><li><strong>Influencer marketing.</strong>&nbsp;As a beginner with a limited marketing budget, influencer marketing can be an affordable way to reach your target audience. Influencers often hold more trust with their followers than traditional advertising. Consider negotiating an affiliate fee rather than a flat rate to create a mutually beneficial partnership.</li><li><strong>Content marketing.&nbsp;</strong>To establish a sustainable source of traffic for your store, incorporate content marketing into your dropshipping business plan. Begin a blog centered around your dropshipping niche and produce content that both entertains and educates your target audience. You can also explore avenues like YouTube, infographics, podcasts, and more to promote your brand.</li><li><strong>Engaging with Communities.</strong> Join groups or communities where people are passionate about your niche. Engage with potential customers on platforms like Reddit, Facebook Groups, and online forums. Aim to offer help and build relationships with potential customers, fostering trust in your brand and encouraging them to make purchases.</li><li><strong>Mobile marketing.&nbsp;</strong>Connect with customers on their mobile devices by establishing a VIP text club, providing customer support through Messenger, or using other mobile marketing strategies.</li><li><strong>Email marketing.&nbsp;</strong>Email marketing is a powerful tool for dropshipping businesses. It helps build lasting relationships with customers, leading to repeat purchases. Send targeted, personalized content, including promotional offers, product recommendations, and informative newsletters to increase customer engagement and boost sales.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As with any online business, closely monitor the performance of your chosen marketing channels and adjust your strategy as needed. This flexibility allows you to lower costs and maximize revenue as your business grows and improves.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 9: Analyze and Improve Your Offering</h3><p>After running your dropshipping business and marketing it for some time, it's crucial to analyze the results of your efforts. CanCan analytics can provide insights into critical aspects of your online store, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Sales:&nbsp;</strong>Identify your top-performing channels, allocate advertising budgets effectively, pinpoint your best-selling products, and understand your most valuable customers.</li><li><strong>Shopper behavior:</strong>&nbsp;Determine whether customers prefer shopping on desktop or mobile devices and analyze conversion rates for each.</li><li><strong>Profit margins:&nbsp;</strong>Identify the most profitable products and variant SKUs, and track sales and gross profits on a month-over-month basis.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In addition to CanCan analytics, you can use tools such as Google Analytics and Search Console to measure search traffic trends over time and enhance your search engine optimization (SEO) strategies. Moreover, if you're using third-party apps for social media or Messenger marketing, review reports regularly to ensure your overall strategy aligns with your business goals.</p><p>When establishing a dropshipping ecommerce store, create a data-driven analytics system. Maintain consistency in your analysis over time and measure your store's performance against key performance indicators (KPIs). This approach empowers you to make informed decisions for your store's growth and advancement over time.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/oie_18165656v138YgNM.gif?18099574475322163599" alt="Template Icon"></p><p>Starting a dropshipping business is an excellent opportunity for both new entrepreneurs and experienced business owners to venture into the world of ecommerce.
