  "dRamps operate through a network of independent agents worldwide.

  "What is the purpose of collateralization in Decentralized Ramps?": "去中心化 dRamps 中抵押的目的是什麼？",
  "Collateralization serves as a security measure to ensure the value and stability of the minted tokens.

  "This will burn the specified amount of the selected token from your wallet and send you the equivalent amount of the corresponding FIAT currency. To burn a token on an automatic ramp, the ramp contract retrieves the requested amount of tokens from the burner's wallet on the blockchain minus the ramp's burning fee then the platform uses a payment processor like Stripe to send the requested amount in the equivalent FIAT currency to the burner's payment processor account. To burn tokens on a manual ramp, the burner would have to send a request for burn through PayChat to the admin of the ramp who will then manually run the burn function through this form and then send the necessary payment to the burner. Manual ramps will list all payment methods they accept and will have guidelines in their descriptions (available at the top left of their ramp's panel) about how to proceed. With manual ramps, you should be able to find a ramp that accepts your payment method no matter what it is: cash, mobile money, etc.": "這將燃燒您錢包中所選代幣的指定數量，並將相應的 FIAT 貨幣的等值金額發送給您。要在自動 dRamp 上燒毀代幣，dRamp 合同從區塊鏈上的燒毀者錢包中檢索所請求的代幣數量，減去 dRamp 的燒毀費用，然後平台使用像 Stripe 這樣的支付處理器將所請求的金額以等值的 FIAT 貨幣發送到燒毀者的支付處理器帳戶中。要在手動 dRamp 上燒毀代幣，燒毀者必須通過 PayChat 向 dRamp 的管理員發送燒毀請求，然後管理員將通過此表單手動運行燒毀功能，然後向燒毀者發送必要的付款。手動 dRamp 將列出其接受的所有付款方式，並將在其描述中提供指南（可在其 dRamp 面板左上角找到）以了解如何進行操作。對於手動 dRamp，您應該能夠找到一個接受您的付款方式的 dRamp，無論它是什麼：現金、移動支付等。",

Partnering with a token market that becomes under-collateralized and thus unable to mint new tokens will reward you with a share of its earnings. Your share is computed as the percentage of the total token market's bounty balance. If the sum of all the token market's bounties' balances is 100 and you have contributed 40% of than, then you will earn 40% of all the proceeds made by the token market. A token market becoming under-collateralized is therefore a huge opportunity for investors to partner with it. A token market might become under-collateralized if its blockchain's native token loses so much in value that the total balance of the bounties attached to the token market is now worth less than the total number of tokens minted by that token market.": "這將把您添加為所選代幣市場的合作夥伴。您只能與當前資金不足的代幣市場合作，目標是通過將您的賞金添加到它們的賞金中，幫助它們再次實現超抵押。與一個資金不足的代幣市場合作，因此無法鑄造新代幣，將獎勵您一部分收益。您的份額是根據總代幣市場賞金餘額的百分比計算的。如果所有代幣市場賞金餘額的總和為 100，而您貢獻了其中的 40%，那麼您將賺取代幣市場所有收益的 40%。代幣市場變得資金不足對投資者來說是一個巨大的合作機會。如果代幣市場的區塊鏈原生代幣價值大幅下跌，以至於連接到代幣市場的賞金的總餘額現在少於該代幣市場鑄造的總代幣數，則代幣市場可能變得資金不足。",

To mint tokens on a manual ramp, the minter would have to send a request for mint through PayChat to the admin of the ramp who will then manually run the mint function through this form after having received the necessary payment from the minter. Manual ramps will list all payment methods they accept and will have guidelines in their descriptions (available at the top left of their ramp's panel) about how to proceed.
