  "How do Decentralized Ramps work?": "去中心化 dRamps 如何工作？",
  "dRamps operate through a network of independent agents worldwide. These agents deploy their own ramps, connecting payment processors like Stripe, and eventually PayPal and others, to facilitate the conversion of fiat currencies into their equivalent blockchain tokens.

  "What is the purpose of collateralization in Decentralized Ramps?": "在去中心化 dRamps 中抵押的目的是什么？",
  "Collateralization serves as a security measure to ensure the value and stability of the minted tokens.

This collateralization guarantees that minted tokens are backed by real-world value and mitigates risks associated with value fluctuations.": "抵押作为一种安全措施，确保铸造的代币的价值和稳定性。代理人使用区块链的本地货币创建赏金/抵押品，然后将其附加到他们的 dRamps 上以进行抵押。这种抵押保证了铸造的代币有实际价值的支持，并减轻了与价值波动相关的风险。",
  "How do agents activate their ramps in the dRamps system?": "代理人如何在 dRamps 系统中激活他们的 dRamps？",
  "Agents activate their ramps by attaching bounties/collaterals to their ramps . These collaterals are placed in the blockchain's native currency. This process allows the agents to enable their ramps to process 80% of the collaterals' value. By attaching a unique profile to their ramps, agents can increase this percentage to 100%.": "代理人通过将赏金/抵押品附加到他们的 dRamps 上来激活它们。这些抵押品放置在区块链的本地货币中。此过程允许代理人启用其 dRamps 处理 80% 的抵押品价值。通过将独特的配置文件附加到他们的 dRamps 上，代理人可以将此百分比提高到 100%。",
